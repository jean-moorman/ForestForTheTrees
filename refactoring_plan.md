# Phase Four Refactoring Plan

## Current Structure Analysis
The `phase_four.py` file is quite large (1200+ lines) and contains several distinct components:
- Enums and data classes for compiler types and states
- Multiple agent classes for different aspects of code generation and compilation
- A main interface class for Phase Four operations

## Proposed Modular Structure
I recommend splitting the file into the following modules:

### 1. `phase_four/models.py`
- Contains data models, enums, and data classes
- Includes: `CompilerType`, `CompilationState`, `CompilationResult`, `CompilationContext`

### 2. `phase_four/agents/`
- Directory for agent-specific implementations
- **`__init__.py`** - For package exports
- **`code_generation.py`** - `CodeGenerationAgent` implementation
- **`static_compilation.py`** - `StaticCompilationAgent` implementation
- **`debug.py`** - `CompilationDebugAgent` implementation
- **`analysis.py`** - `CompilationAnalysisAgent` implementation
- **`refinement.py`** - `CompilationRefinementAgent` implementation

### 3. `phase_four/utils.py`
- Utility functions used by multiple agents
- Example: `_parse_compiler_output` could be moved here

### 4. `phase_four/interface.py`
- Contains the `PhaseFourInterface` class
- Handles high-level coordination between agents

### 5. `phase_four/__init__.py`
- Package exports for easy imports
- Could re-export `PhaseFourInterface` as the main entry point

## Implementation Steps

1. Create the directory structure
2. Move models to their own file
3. Move each agent to its own file
4. Extract shared utilities to utils.py
5. Move interface to interface.py
6. Create an __init__.py that re-exports the main components
7. Update imports throughout the codebase

## Benefits

- **Improved maintainability**: Each file focuses on a single responsibility
- **Better code organization**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Easier testing**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Enhanced collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different modules
- **Reduced cognitive load**: Smaller files are easier to understand
