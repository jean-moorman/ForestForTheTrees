"""
Advanced thread safety tests for the event system.

This test suite provides additional testing for the event system's thread safety
with more complex scenarios including:
1. High-volume concurrent event emission and processing
2. Cross-thread event serialization and deserialization
3. Rate limiting under concurrent access
4. Thread interruption and error recovery
5. Complex actor model interaction patterns
