"""
Phase Two Package - Systematic Development Process
=================================================

This package manages the systematic development process, taking structural components
from Phase One and implementing them through a test-driven approach. Components are 
developed from most fundamental to least, and each one goes through test creation,
implementation, testing, and integration.

The main entry point is the PhaseTwo class in the orchestrator module, which coordinates
the entire development process.
