2. The feature improvement strategy
3. The feature combination strategy

    This test function validates that the evolutionary selection mechanism was properly 
    implemented in the FFTT system.
    
    Key components now implemented:
    
    1. Natural Selection Agent
       - Collects feedback from phase zero specialized agents
       - Evaluates features based on performance metrics
       - Makes decisions about which features to keep, improve, replace, or combine
    
    2. Feature Replacement Strategy
       - Conceptual Replacement: Reusing code from high-performing features
       - Pragmatic Replacement: Recreating features from scratch with improvements
       - Proper tracking and disabling of replaced features
    
    3. Feature Improvement Strategy
       - Using Phase Four to improve existing implementations
       - Targeted improvements based on performance analysis
       - Static compilation verification of improved code
    
    4. Feature Combination Strategy
       - Combining multiple features into unified implementations
       - Proper dependency management during combination
       - Reducing codebase complexity through strategic combinations
    
    The implementation includes:
    - Metrics and event tracking for evolutionary decisions
    - State persistence for feature replacements and improvements
    - Integration with phase four for code generation and improvement
    - Clear threshold-based decision making for low-performance features
